# Causal_Broadcast-in-elixir
The Erlang virtual machine provides facilities for asynchronous point-to-point message passing. You are asked to simulate broadcast functionality on top of point-to-point channels to achieve more advanced quality of service requirements. Write a module CausalBC.ex that implements causal broadcast1. The module should provide (at least) the following interface functions:start(name,participants): Spawns a new process and registers it under the provided name. The spawned process stores the list of the names of the participants in its local state. Returns the spawned process ID. bc send(msg,name): Causes the message msg to be broadcast to all participating processes that have executed start. Parameter name refers to the senderâ€™s name. To signify the receipt of a causal order broadcast message msg at a participating process pi, where msg was sent by a process called origin, a notification message of the form f:bc rcvd,msg,origing should be received by pi
